1. Create Overview.md
@Codebase 
I want to develop a minimalistic nextjs app for small-to-medium gastronomy businesses to efficiently manage reservations. It offers an intuitive interface to handle key reservation tasks: adding, editing, and deleting reservations. The app supports two types of users: admins, who can manage users and reservations, and employees, who can manage only the reservation system. The desired flows are: 
1. User Flow: Anyone can open the webapp, enter email and password, authenticate via Firebase Authentication and if successful receive a role.  
2. Employee Flow:
- Employees have access to a dashboard view Monthly, weekly and daily view to reservation book. Depending on current view, the “add reservation form” is prefilled with data.  
- Create a new reservation: tap floating “+” button, reservation form opens, input required information, tap save to store to firebase. 
- Edit/delete a reservation: tap on a reservation, reservation modal opens with editable details, tap save to save, or delete and confirm to delete. 
3. Admin Flow: 
- Access to the User Management with a list of current users. 
- Click on a user to delete. 
- Add a button to create a new user. 

Create an overview SOP file in the documentation folder and name it overview.md. Break down all of the steps that we need to create the MVP of this product. Make sure to mark everything with markdown checkboxes as we progress. We dont need to talk about deployment or testing, focus on the steps to get a working version of the app.
