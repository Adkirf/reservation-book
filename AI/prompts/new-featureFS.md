Please review the current codebase thoroughly and give me a folder structure of all files that are affected by this new feature. Do NOT implement any code - focus purely on identifiyng all necessary exisitng or new files. 

**New Feature**
Language selector for the app. 
- Create a english.json file and place it in a suitable folder
- Review the folder structure to identify all folders that potentially use hardcoded text. 
- Create a SOP with a checklist of all folders that need to be updated one by one. 
- Do not include files, only potentially affected folders.
