Please review the current project thoroughly and give me a folder structure of all files that are affected by this new feature. Do NOT implement any code - focus purely on identifiyng all necessary exisitng or new files. 

**New Feature**
- AddItemForm
 - A multipage form with icons for pagination
 - Each page correspdonds to field of the "adding item" state in the ReservationProvider
 - The last step closes the component and populates the ReservationProvider "current item" state variable, if all requried fields are provided
 - Includes a small Select field for "reservation" or "task"
